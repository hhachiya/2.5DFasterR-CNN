### 2.5D Faster R-CNN 
2.5D Faster R-CNN is an extension of Faster R-CNN to enable it to detect the bounding-box of a target object and estimate its distance at the same time. To do this, 2D anchors in original Faster R-CNN are extended to 5 dimensional vectors including the distance candidate.

This repository provides codes for 2.5D Faster R-CNN proposed by Hirotaka Hachiya. The codes are based on [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) and written in python.
